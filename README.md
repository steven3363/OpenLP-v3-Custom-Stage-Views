# OpenLP V3 Custom-Stage-Views
A collection of Custom Stage views for OpenLP v3

Tested with V3.1.6 linux should work with all versions of OpenLP v3 and with OBS 31.1.2 linux
#have had comments on Mac that the stage view flases in OBS. 

# Installation instructions

Download the 'stages' folder above and copy it to the data folder of your OpenLP folder. Please include all the files.

Insure the 'Remote Plugin' is enabled. 

To use in OBS you need to use the 'Browser Source'. Point them the stage view url with the folder name inside 'Stage'

EG: If you want to view the lower third you would point to the following link.

  http://{yourremote}:4316/stage/LowerThird
  

OBS web sockets is not working at the moment. Updates to come.
Update: I have modified the stage views so that OBS remote is not required - Each stage view will check and see the type matches and OpenLP is live. This means you can create one scene on OBS with your choice of view for Bibles or Songs and Esch stage view will dynamically hide themselves depending on what OpenLP is currently displaying.


Print song removed. 

Chords and video backgrounds are part of v3 so they have been removed
